Clean this OCR text from handwritten notes.

Rules:
- Correct spelling errors, typos, and contextually impossible words (e.g., if OCR sees "voter line" in a plumbing context, correct it to "water line").
- Remove spurious line breaks, OCR artifacts, headers, and page numbers.
- Format the text into clean, readable paragraphs.
- Preserve the original meaning and voice; do not summarize different sections.
- Do not add new content.

Output plain text only.
